Fetching data from api

-for fetching data from api we need something to fetch so we are using axios for that

go to vs code client app and execute npm install axios.
and then write this to get data in app.tsx

 const [activities, setActivities] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('http://localhost:5000/api/activities')
    .then(response => {
      console.log(response);
      setActivities(response.data);
    })
  },[] )

This is a React component using the useState and useEffect hooks to fetch data from a REST API using Axios.

The useState hook is used to define a state variable named activities, which is initially set to undefined. The setActivities function returned by useState is used to update the value of activities.

The useEffect hook is used to run the code inside the callback function when the component mounts (because the dependency array is empty []). Inside the callback function, an HTTP GET request is sent to http://localhost:5000/api/activities using Axios. When the response is received, the data is logged to the console and the setActivities function is called to update the state variable activities with the data received from the API.

In summary, this code fetches data from an API and updates the state of a React component with the received data.
we are using sementic ui and made some changes wrt that.
