WALKING SKELETON PART1 - API

WALKING SKELETON - "A Walking skeleteon is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end 
function. It need not use the final architecture , but it should link together the main architectural components.
The architecture and functionality can then evolve in parallel."
