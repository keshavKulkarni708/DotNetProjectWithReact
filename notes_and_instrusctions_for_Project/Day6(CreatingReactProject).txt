Day 6

Creating the React project
NOTE:
(To conclude, JSX = JS, typescript is a superset of Javascript, and there is no comparison between JSX and TypeScript.)

We want to create new project of React in which We are using TypeScript.
For that type this command on terminal in Reactivities Folder
npx create-react-app client-app --use-npm --template typescript

After running this command it will create a client-app(React) folder with typescript in it.

React Components:

React do not work on traditional code base like in traditional we write one html file one css file and one JS file,
but in react we create components and each component have these all 3 html,css,Js. and we can reuse these components in various places as we need.

React has virtual dom, so as we change something in code it will render and reflect it in website immediately.

React has one way binding.

Q.Why to use TypeScript?
**TypeScript Rocks!**
- Strong typing
- Object Oriented
- Better intellisense
- Access modifiers
- Future JS support
- Catches silly mistakes in dev
- 3rd party libraries
- Easy to learn if you know JS
- Much important in React

**typescript is annoying!**
-More upfront code
-3rd party library
-Strict mode is ...strict!
