TypeScript

1)What is TypeScript?
-> TypeScript is a programming language which build on top of Javascript, and it is strict than Javascript.
-> TypeScript is a statically typed language. Statically types means if we declare a variable we will know it at comile tie only and we cannot change that in runtime.
eg. int number = 11;
	number = "s" //we cannot do this
	
In opposite in dynamically typed we can change the value at runtime.
eg. let number = 11;
	number = "s" //this is possible.
